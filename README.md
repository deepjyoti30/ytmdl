## Web App

Ytmdl also has an web app, you can try it out [here](https://ytmdl.deepjyoti30.dev/)

## Why this?

This app downloads a song by getting the audio from Youtube sources __using__ youtube-dl and then adds song information like
artist name, album name, release date, thumbnail etc by fetching it from sources like Itunes, Spotify, Gaana and other sources.

__NO__. YoutubeDL doesn't do that. All youtube-dl does is lets you download audio from a video that you specify.
__This app is not yet another youtube-dl clone.__

## Configuration

### Setup

The defaults can be changed by editing the config file in ytmdl folder in your .config folder

The config will be created automatically the first time you run `ytmdl` and will be present in ~/.config/ytmdl/config

However, it can be created manually by the following command

```console
mkdir -p ~/.config/ytmdl; curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/deepjyoti30/ytmdl/master/examples/config > ~/.config/ytmdl/config
```

Above command will download the config from the repo and save it in the `~/.config/ytmdl/` directory.

### Supported Options

As of the latest development branch, the following options can be changed from the config

| Name                 | Description                                        | Default                        |
|:--------------------:|----------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| `SONG_DIR`           | Directory to save the songs in after editing       | Current directory              |
| `SONG_QUALITY`       | Quality of the song                                | 320kbps                        |
| `METADATA_PROVIDERS` | Which API providers to use for metadata            | all supported options are used |
| `DEFAULT_FORMAT`     | Default format of the song                         | mp3                            |
| `ON_META_ERROR`      | What to do if error occurs while writing meta      | exit                           |
| `ITUNES_COUNTRY`     | Which region to use while searching from Itunes    | US                             |
| `SPOTIFY_COUNTRY`    | Which market to use while searching from Spotify   | US                             |

### Advanced Configuration

#### Dynamically storing songs

`SONG_DIR` field also takes values that are extracted from the song being downloaded

The `SONG_DIR` field needs to be passed some special values in order to achieve that. The string is scanned and when a `$` sign occurs, the special string will start and each directory can be separated by using an `->` sign.

To save the song in the `/dir/<album_name>/<artist_name>/<title>/<song_name>.mp3` format, the following needs to be added in the `SONG_DIR` field.

```
SONG_DIR="/dir$Album->Artist->Title"
```

Above will extract to the following directory structure when a song named `Cradles` by artist `Sub Urban` from the album `Cradles - Single`

```
|--dir
   |--Cradles - Single
      |--Sub Urban
         |--Cradles
            |--Cradles.mp3
```

In order to pass the name with which the song should be saved, the last attribute can be passed between `[]`.

If the `SONG_DIR` field is `/dir$Album->[Artist]` will extract to the following directory structure

```
|--dir
   |--Cradles - Single
      |--Sub Urban.mp3
```

#### Supported options for dynamic storing

As of the latest source, the following options can be passed to the special string in order to create dynamic directories

| Name          |                               |
|:-------------:|-------------------------------|
| `Artist`      | Artist Of the Song            |
| `Album`       | Album Of the Song             |
| `Title`       | Title Of the Song             |
| `Genre`       | Genre Of the Song             |
| `TrackNumber` | TrackNumber Of the Song       |
| `ReleaseDate` | ReleaseDate Of the Song       |
